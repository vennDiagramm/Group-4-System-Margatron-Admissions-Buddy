h2,AboutCivil Engineering
p,The civil engineering course targets establishing a strong underpinning of the principal concepts of science in league with mathematical and computational tools to alleviate challenging challenges through development and sustainability.
p,"The program’s cornerstone is learner-centered, augmenting theoretical knowledge and skills in Mathematics, physical and natural sciences, engineering sciences, and all civil engineering activities. Most importantly, it aims to continuously deliver the highest quality, large-scale technical, scientific, and liberal education to capacitate learners to meet the local and global standards in the field of civil engineering. This is particularly emphasized in leading civil engineering schools across the Philippines’ civil engineering courses."
h2,Educational Objectives
li,"Graduates of civil engineering courses will have the technical skills and professional qualifications to become competent engineers who can support the industry, academia, or government."
li,"Graduates of civil engineering schools will be collaborators and innovators in the field, leading or participating in efforts to address social, technical, ethical, and business challenges."
li,"Graduates of the civil engineering program will be engaged in life-long learning and professional development, similar to those enrolled in a computer science course Philippines."
h3,Program Outcomes
p,Graduates of the Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering program are expected to demonstrate:
ul,"An ability to apply mathematics, science, and engineering knowledge is foundational to theCivil Engineering course;An ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data;An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability;An ability to function on multidisciplinary teams;An ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems;An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility;An ability to communicate effectively;The broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context;A recognition of the need for and an ability to engage in life-long learning;A knowledge of contemporary issues;An ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice;Knowledge and understanding of engineering and management principles as a member and leader in a team to manage projects in multidisciplinary environments andUnderstanding at least one specialized field of civil engineering practice."
