h2,About Industrial Engineering
p,"Industrial Engineering program focuses on the optimal mastery of the complex processes in crafting, improving, and installing products and integrated systems of people, information, equipment, and energy."
p,"With outcomes-based education, it gears up learnerâ€™s knowledge and competencies in Mathematics, physical and social sciences in conjunction with the principles and methods of engineering analysis and design to empirically assess outcomes from varied systems. Also, the program advances learners to potentially establish iron-like foundation in both manufacturing and service industries. This hones learners to qualify in the local and global standards in the field of industrial engineering."
h2,Educational Objectives
li,"Graduates of industrial engineering program will have the technical skills and professional qualifications to become competent engineers who can support the industry, academe, or government."
li,"Graduates of industrial engineering program will be collaborators and innovators in the field, leading or participating in efforts to address social, technical, ethical and business challenges."
li,Graduates of industrial engineering program will be engaged in life-long learning and professional development.
h2,Program Outcomes
p,Graduates of the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering program are expected to demonstrate:
ul,"An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering;An ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data;An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability;An ability to function on multi-disciplinary teams;An ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems;An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility;An ability to communicate effectively;The broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context;A recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning;A knowledge of contemporary issues;An ability to use the techniques, skills and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice;Knowledge and understanding of engineering and management principles as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments; andAbility to design, develop, implement and improve integrated systems that include people, materials, information, equipment and energy."
