h2,About Computer Engineering
p,"Computer Engineering program centers on the learnerâ€™s acquisition of knowledge and development of adroitness in computer, communication, and information technology."
p,"The program aids to foster the excellent command on designing, developing, implementing, maintaining, and integrating computer hardware and software, and understanding their interdependence. Thus, the program fundamentally fortifies mastery on computer engineering, its application, and its primal concepts to qualify learners to meet the local and global standards in the field of computer engineering."
h2,Educational Objectives
li,"Graduates of computer engineering program will have the technical skills and professional qualifications to become competent engineers who can support the industry, academe, or government."
li,"Graduates of computer engineering program will be collaborators and innovators in the field, leading or participating in efforts to address social, technical, ethical and business challenges."
li,Graduates of computer engineering program will be engaged in life-long learning and professional development.
h2,Program Outcomes
p,Graduates of the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering program are expected to demonstrate:
ul,"An ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering;An ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data;An ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability;An ability to function on multi-disciplinary teams;An ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems;An understanding of professional and ethical responsibility;An ability to communicate effectively;The broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context;A recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning;A knowledge of contemporary issues;An ability to use the techniques, skills and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice; andKnowledge and understanding of engineering and management principles as a member and leader in a team, to manage projects and in multidisciplinary environments."
